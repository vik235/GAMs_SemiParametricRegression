# GAMs_SemiParametricRegression

This repo contains the Generalized Additive Model fits and related concepts. 
Reference is in HRW et al. Semi parametric Regression and mgcv package by Simon Woods along with his text Generalized Additive Models. 
While this deals majorly with GAM but code references shows its inter relationship , pros and cons with Linear models, variable selection
aka regularization, Cox Regression , Poisson / NB over dispersed models etc.
